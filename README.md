# ~$ whoami

Hey, I’m Matt a hands on infrastructure engineer with a love for macOS and the Apple ecosystem. I thrive on GitOps, automation and building systems. 

I focus on creating environments that are simple, scalable and reproducible through Infrastructure as Code. Whether it’s macOS, Linux or networking I’m happiest when infrastructure flows quietly in the background doing exactly what it should.

I'm passionate about:

- **GitOps & Infrastructure as Code** – Making every system change auditable, testable, and reversible.
- **Apple Ecosystem Management** – MDM, Jamf, and macOS automation.
- **Automation & DevOps Principles** – SaltStack, pipelines, and reproducible environments. Salt all of the things!
