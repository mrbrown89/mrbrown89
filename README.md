# ~$ whoami

Hey, I’m Matt. I’m a hands-on infrastructure and systems engineer who thrives on automation, GitOps, and building systems that just work. I love crafting workflows and pipelines that are repeatable, transparent, and reliable—where every commit, build, or automation step is tangible progress.

I focus on creating environments that are efficient, scalable, and simple to maintain. Whether it’s macOS, Windows, Linux, or networking, I’m happiest when infrastructure flows quietly in the background, doing exactly what it should, freeing people to focus on their work.

I have a particular passion for:

- **GitOps & Infrastructure as Code** – Making every system change auditable, testable, and reversible.
- **Apple Ecosystem Management** – MDM, Jamf, and macOS automation.
- **Automation & DevOps Principles** – SaltStack, pipelines, and reproducible environments.
- **Open & Transparent Systems** – Building infrastructure that’s elegant, reliable, and human-focused.

I experiment with new tools in safe development environments before deploying to production, and I share what I learn here through projects and articles.
